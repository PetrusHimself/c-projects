Libft
=====

The Libft project is one of the first projects assigned in the Ecole 42 curriculum. The goal of the project is to create a library of common C functions that can be reused in future projects. The project requires that all functions be implemented from scratch, without the use of external libraries.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the Libft project, you'll need to download the project files from the Ecole 42 repository. Once you have the files, you can compile the library by running the `make` command.

Functionality
-------------

The Libft library includes a variety of functions, including:

*   Memory functions: `malloc`, `free`, `memset`, `memcpy`, etc.
*   String functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, etc.
*   Character functions: `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `toupper`, `tolower`, etc.
*   Linked list functions: `lstnew`, `lstadd_front`, `lstsize`, `lstlast`, etc.
*   And many more!

Contributions
-------------

Although the goal of the project is to implement all functions from scratch, there may be opportunities to optimize and improve upon the code. Additionally, the project can be expanded to include additional functions that may be useful in future projects.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Conclusion
----------

The Libft project is an excellent introduction to the C language and serves as a foundation for future projects in the Ecole 42 curriculum. By implementing a variety of common functions from scratch, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how the C language works and develop essential programming skills.
