c-projects
==========

This repository contains C programming projects from the Ecole 42 curriculum. I will be completing these projects to improve my C programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of computer science concepts.

Projects
--------

### Libft

Libft is a library consisting of basic C functions used in other projects. These functions include string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked lists. The project serves as an introduction to the basics of C programming.

### Get Next Line

Get Next Line is a function that reads a file line by line. The function returns the next line of the file each time it is called until the end of the file is reached. The project focuses on file input/output and memory allocation.

### Printf

Printf is a function that prints formatted output. The function accepts a format string and any additional arguments to be printed. The project serves as an introduction to variable argument functions and memory allocation.
